Comparison Of NoSQL Databases Hive, Cassandra & MongoDB:
Hive:
Key characteristics:

·        Data warehousing tool which relies on features of Hadoop

·        Built on top of Hadoop HDFS

·        AP on CAP

Good for:

·        Support for a variety of data formats

·        Query execution through data processing tools

·        Provides high security

Not good for:

·        Classic transactional applications or even relational analytics

·        OLTP applications


Cassandra:
Key characteristics:

·        High availability

·        Incremental scalability

·        Eventually consistent

·        Trade-offs between consistency and latency

·        Minimal administration

·        No SPF (Single point of failure) – all nodes are the same in Cassandra

·        AP on CAP

Good for:

·        Simple setup, maintenance code

·        Fast random read/write

·        Flexible parsing/wide column requirement

·        No multiple secondary index needed

Not good for:

·        Secondary index

·        Relational data

·        Transactional operations (Rollback, Commit)

·        Primary & Financial record

·        Stringent and authorization needed on data

·        Dynamic queries/searching on column data

·        Low latency

MongoDB:
Key characteristics:

·        Schemas to change as applications evolve (Schema-free)

·        Full index support for high performance

·        Replication and failover for high availability

·        Auto Sharding for easy Scalability

·        Rich document based queries for easy readability

·        Master-slave model

·        CP on CAP

Good for:

·        RDBMS replacement for web applications

·        Semi-structured content management

·        Real-time analytics and high-speed logging, caching and high scalability

Not good for:

·        Highly transactional system

·        Applications with traditional database requirements such as foreign key constraints
